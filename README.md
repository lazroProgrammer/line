# Line: a messaging app

A messaging app that is built using flutter, you directly message whoever you want just by searching, this is a learning project that should be completed in 10 to 15 days considering the novelty of the things here to me. for now the project is officialy paused due to occupation in 04/05/2025

## Why:
- learn to use firebase authentication and firestore and perhaps firebase storage.
- to manage realtime changes using firestore and streams.
- to create my first real noSQL schema.
- infrastructure to learn to use audio player and media player later with multiple data formats.

## Features
- User authentication with Firebase Auth
- Real-time messaging with Firestore
- Multi-device sync via Firestore
- Dark mode and responsive UI

## Tech Stack

### Packages used
- Getx for state management
- Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Storage)
- SharedPreferences for local storage
- Logger for logging and debugging

### Notice:
This project is still under development. For this project, I aim to finish an MVP when I'm free. May is a busy month for me, so I'm going to try and finish the core functionality in 10 days when I'm available. As of 04/05/2025, the UI prototype is completed and done in the first day.
